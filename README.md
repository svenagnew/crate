Crate
=====

`crate` is a tiny utility to aid in the easy re-installation of a homebrew repository containing packages at specific versions.

Driven out of a need to replicate Homebrew repositories prior and post `boxen` installation, `crate` is intended to be used both standalone & from within a script.
